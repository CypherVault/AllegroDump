OrcadLite Missing Files (library)

Path to place missing key files. Be sure to manually import them all in the program or system wil not recognize the new OLB files.

C: \Cadence\SPB_17.2\tools\capture\library
{C should be your main windows drive letter.}
{your SPB_XX.X might be different depending on the versions youve downloaded.}


As of 9/16/2022, I plan to include the ZIP, seperate files, and automation script for placing these. I will be learning Windows Batch in order to accomplish this. -CRN
